    description: `Apply targeted changes to an existing file in the vault by finding and replacing specific content.

This tool modifies specific sections of a file by matching exact content and replacing it with new content. It works by performing direct string match and replace operations. Multiple patches can be applied in a single call by providing corresponding arrays of old and new content.

**CRITICAL:** The content to match must be EXACTLY as it appears in the file - including all whitespace, indentation, blank lines, and line breaks.

Call this function:
- When making small, targeted edits to large files (a few lines changed)
- When making edits in the middle of a file where you have clear surrounding context
- When making simple line additions, deletions, or replacements with minimal changes
- When you know the exact content that needs to be changed
- When making multiple independent edits to the same file (use multiple entries in the arrays)

Do NOT use this function:
- When rewriting most or all of a file's content
- When you haven't read the file first to know the exact content to match
- When the match might be ambiguous (appears multiple times in the file)

Illustrated Markdown documents:
- To insert available user-uploaded or model-generated images, put placeholders in newContent such as {{image:hero}}, {{image:diagram-1}}, or {{image:photo}}.
- Do NOT invent vault image paths. The plugin replaces image placeholders with real Obsidian embeds after saving media locally.
- oldContent must still match the existing file exactly; only newContent placeholders are replaced.`,

CRITICAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
- Each entry must match the file content EXACTLY character-for-character
- Include all whitespace, indentation, and line breaks exactly as they appear
- Include enough context to make each match unique within the file
- Typically include 2-3 lines before and after the change for context
- Match complete lines/statements to avoid breaking code structure
- Preserve all blank lines that exist in the original

WARNING: The replacement will fail if:
- Any content entry doesn't exist in the file
- Whitespace/indentation doesn't match exactly
- Any match is ambiguous (appears multiple times in the file)
- Line breaks are missing or incorrect
- The number of oldContent entries doesn't match the number of newContent entries`
