This plugin was originally created for a friend who found it useful, so I have decided to release it to the Obsidian community.

If you find any issues or have a feature request, please feel free to raise them on GitHub:`,

    HelpModalGettingStartedTitle = "Getting started",

1. **Add an API key**: Go to Settings and add at least one API key (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, or Mistral)
2. **Select a model**: Choose your preferred AI model from the dropdown
3. **Open the chat**: Click the plugin icon in the sidebar to start chatting`,

**Read-only (default)** - The AI can safely explore your vault:
- Search through your notes (including PDFs and Office/ODF documents)
- Read file contents (including binary files like PDFs, Office documents, and images)
- List directory structures
- Cannot modify anything

**Allow Edits** - Switch on when you need the AI to make changes:
- Create new notes
- Edit existing content
- Delete or move files
- Rename files

**Planning** - Have the AI plan before acting:
- A planning agent analyzes your vault and creates a strategy
- An execution agent carries out the given plan`,

    HelpModalReferenceTitle = "Using references",
    HelpModalReferenceContent = `#### Using references

Quickly provide context to the AI:

Customize AI behavior for specific workflows:

1. Create markdown files in **Vaultkeeper AI/User Instructions/**

See [[Vaultkeeper AI/User Instructions/EXAMPLE_INSTRUCTIONS|Example Template]] for help getting started.`,

    HelpModalQuickActionsTitle = "Quick actions",
    HelpModalQuickActionsContent = `#### Quick actions

Quick actions are one-click AI edits you run on the note you're currently editing. Open the editor menu (right-click, or the command palette) and pick an action. Some actions work on your current selection if you have text selected, otherwise they apply to the whole note.

##### Proofread
Corrects spelling, grammar, punctuation, and typos without rewriting for style or changing your voice. Works on the selection if you have one, otherwise the whole note.

##### Beautify
Improves clarity, flow, and readability and adds Markdown formatting (headings, bold, lists, blockquotes) where it helps. Works on the selection if you have one, otherwise the whole note.

##### Apply template
Restructures the note to match a template you choose, fitting your content to the template's headings and structure while preserving the information. If the file you pick doesn't look like a template, no changes are made.

##### Apply links
Scans the note for mentions of pages that already exist in your vault and wraps them in wikilinks. It only links existing pages and never invents new ones. Works on the selection if you have one, otherwise the whole note.

##### Apply tags
Chooses tags for the note from the tags that already exist in your vault and merges them into the frontmatter. It won't create new tags — only ones already in use elsewhere.

##### Suggest tags
Like Apply tags, but free to suggest new tags as well as reuse existing ones. Suggested tags are merged into the note's frontmatter.

##### Generate frontmatter
Infers YAML frontmatter for the note (aliases, tags, title, summary, created) from its content and merges it into any existing frontmatter.`,

    HelpModalUploadedFilesTitle = "Uploaded files",
    HelpModalUploadedFilesContent = `#### Uploaded files

When you upload files (PDFs, images) to conversations, they are stored by your AI provider. The plugin automatically attempts to delete these files when you delete conversations, but this may occasionally fail due to network issues or API rate limits.

**What to do:**
- Periodically check your provider's dashboard for uploaded files
- Remove any old files that are no longer needed
- Provider-specific details can be found in the plugin settings

**Provider dashboards:**
- Claude: [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Gemini: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- OpenAI: [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Mistral: [Mistral Console](https://console.mistral.ai/)`,

    HelpModalTroubleshootTitle = "Troubleshooting",
    HelpModalTroubleshootContent = `#### Common issues & solutions

##### API key issues

**Problem**: "Invalid API key" or authentication errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify your API key is correct (copy fresh from provider console)
- Check you've added the key for the correct provider
- Ensure no extra spaces when pasting
- API keys are provider-specific - Claude keys only work with Claude models

##### Error code 429: Rate limit exceeded

This error means you've made too many API requests in a given time period. This is separate from your token usage limits.

**How to resolve:**
- Wait for your rate limit to reset (see provider-specific details below)
- Lower the search result and snippet size limits in the plugin settings to reduce request size
- Understand that rate limits typically increase automatically as you use the API more

###### Claude
- **Wait time:** A few hours
- **Long-term solution:** Rate limits increase significantly after reaching cumulative spending thresholds
- [Claude Rate Limits Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/rate-limits)

###### OpenAI
- **Wait time:** A few minutes to an hour
- **Long-term solution:** Rate limits automatically increase as you progress through usage tiers with higher spending
- [OpenAI Rate Limits Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits)

###### Gemini
- **Wait time:** A few minutes (per-minute limits) or until midnight Pacific Time (daily quotas)
- **Long-term solution:** Enable billing to move from free tier to paid tier for significantly higher limits. Paid tier limits increase automatically with cumulative Google Cloud spending
- [Gemini API Rate Limits Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)

##### Error code 503: Service unavailable

This error indicates a temporary issue with the AI provider's servers.

**What it means:**
- The provider's service is temporarily unavailable or overloaded
- This occurs more frequently with Gemini than other providers

**How to resolve:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- There is no action you can take to prevent this error - it's on the provider's side
- If the issue persists, check the provider's status page for any ongoing incidents`,

    HelpModalPrivacyTitle = "Privacy",
    HelpModalPrivacyContent = `#### Privacy & security

##### Data storage

**Everything stays local** - This plugin does NOT send data to any third-party services except the AI providers you choose. It also doesn't collect any telemetry data and you can review the full source code on GitHub.

**What's stored locally**:
- API keys (stored in your vault's plugin settings)
- Conversation history (stored in \`Vaultkeeper AI/Conversations/\`)
- Custom instructions (stored in \`Vaultkeeper AI/User Instructions/\`)
- Plugin settings (stored in \`.obsidian/plugins/vaultkeeper-ai/\`)

##### API communication

**Direct connections only** - The plugin communicates directly with your chosen AI provider:

- **Claude**: Anthropic's API
- **Gemini**: Google's API
- **OpenAI**: OpenAI's API
- **Mistral**: Mistral AI's API

**What gets sent**:
- Your messages and referenced file contents (including binary files like PDFs, Office documents, and images)
- Conversation context (for continuity)
- File names and directory structures (when AI searches)

**What does NOT get sent**:
- Files excluded in settings
- Other plugins' data
- Your vault structure (unless explicitly requested)
- API keys to anyone except the respective provider

##### File exclusions

**Protect sensitive information** using glob patterns in settings:

**Examples**:
- \`private/**\` - Exclude entire directories
- \`*.secret.md\` - Exclude specific file patterns
- \`journal/personal/**\` - Exclude nested directories
- \`.obsidian/workspace.json\` - Exclude specific files

**How exclusions work**:
- Excluded files are completely invisible to the AI
- The AI cannot read, search, modify, or even list excluded files
- Exclusions apply to all operations

##### AI provider policies

Each AI provider has their own data policies:

- [Anthropic (Claude)](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- [Google (Gemini)](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [OpenAI (ChatGPT)](https://openai.com/privacy)
- [Mistral AI](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/privacy-policy)`,

**My recommendation would be to write down in your own words what you would like the AI to specialise in and how you would like it to manage your vault. Then ask an AI to write a system prompt using the latest best practices from your description.**

# System Prompt Template for LLMs (2025)

A clear, structured system prompt template following the latest best practices for effective LLM interactions.

---

## Template Structure

### 1. Role & Identity
**Define who the AI should be.**

\`\`\`
You are [role/persona with specific expertise].
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
You are an experienced technical writer who specializes in creating clear documentation for software developers.
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Role-playing guides the model's tone and depth, helping it understand the appropriate level of expertise and communication style.

---

### 2. Core Objective
**State the primary purpose clearly and directly.**

\`\`\`
Your main goal is to [specific objective].
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Your main goal is to help users write bug-free Python code by providing clear explanations and suggesting best practices.
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Being specific and concise helps the model understand exactly what you want without overloading it with unnecessary information.

---

### 3. Key Behaviors & Guidelines
**List the most important rules the AI should follow.**

\`\`\`
Always:
- [Behavior 1]
- [Behavior 2]
- [Behavior 3]

Never:
- [Restriction 1]
- [Restriction 2]
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Always:
- Explain concepts in simple terms before diving into technical details
- Provide working code examples when suggesting solutions
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

Never:
- Make assumptions about the user's skill level without asking
- Suggest deprecated or insecure coding practices
- Provide code without explaining what it does
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Clear instructions with both positive and negative examples help establish consistent response patterns.

---

### 4. Output Format (Optional)
**Specify how responses should be structured.**

\`\`\`
Format your responses as follows:
[structure description]
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Format your responses as follows:
1. Brief summary (1-2 sentences)
2. Detailed explanation
3. Code example (if applicable)
4. Common pitfalls to avoid
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Defining the expected format helps the model stay focused and produces outputs that are easier to read and use.

---

### 5. Context & Constraints (Optional)
**Add relevant background information or limitations.**

\`\`\`
Context: [relevant background]
Constraints: [specific limitations]
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Context: You're helping developers who are migrating from Python 2 to Python 3.
Constraints: 
- Keep responses under 500 words
- Focus only on Python 3.8+ features
- Assume users have basic Python knowledge
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Providing context ensures relevance while constraints prevent the model from being too verbose or off-topic.

---

### 6. Examples (Optional but Recommended)
**Show the model what good responses look like.**

\`\`\`
Example interaction:
User: [example input]
Assistant: [example output]
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Example interaction:
User: How do I read a CSV file in Python?
Assistant: Here's the most common approach using the pandas library:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

This reads the CSV into a DataFrame, which makes it easy to analyze and manipulate the data. If you don't have pandas installed, use: pip install pandas
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Examples anchor model behavior more effectively than descriptions alone, establishing clear patterns for responses.

---

### 7. Safety & Ethics Guidelines (Recommended)
**Include guardrails for responsible AI use.**

\`\`\`
Safety guidelines:
- [Ethical principle 1]
- [Ethical principle 2]
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Safety guidelines:
- Never provide code that could be used for malicious purposes
- Decline requests that violate privacy or security best practices
- If you're uncertain about something, say so clearly rather than guessing
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Prompt scaffolding with safety logic helps limit the model's ability to produce harmful outputs, even when facing adversarial input.

## Complete Example

Here's a full system prompt using the template:

\`\`\`
You are a friendly Python tutor who helps beginners learn programming through clear explanations and hands-on examples.

Your main goal is to teach Python fundamentals in a way that builds confidence and encourages practice.

Always:
- Break down complex concepts into simple, digestible steps
- Use real-world analogies to explain abstract ideas
- Provide runnable code examples that users can test immediately
- Encourage questions and celebrate progress
- Check for understanding before moving to advanced topics

Never:
- Assume the user knows jargon without explanation
- Skip error handling in code examples
- Make the user feel bad for not understanding something

Format your responses as follows:
1. Concept explanation in plain English
2. Code example with comments
3. What happens when you run it
4. Try it yourself suggestion

Context: You're helping complete beginners who may have never programmed before.
Constraints: Keep explanations under 300 words per concept.

Example interaction:
User: What's a variable?
Assistant: A variable is like a labeled box where you store information. You give it a name, and Python remembers what's inside.

# Create a variable
age = 25

Here we created a variable called "age" and put the number 25 in it. Now whenever we use "age" in our code, Python knows we mean 25.

When you run this, nothing appears on screen yet - Python just remembers it. To see what's inside, use print(age).

Try it yourself: Create a variable called "name" and store your name in it using quotes, like name = "Alex"

Safety guidelines:
- Never suggest downloading packages from untrusted sources
- If a user asks about something potentially harmful, explain why it's risky instead
\`\`\`

## Quick Tips for Writing System Prompts

1. **Be specific, not vague** - "Precise and succinct" prompts get better responses than lengthy, ambiguous ones.

2. **Test and iterate** - Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Test your prompt, observe the outputs, and refine based on results.

3. **Use natural language** - Write like you're briefing a smart colleague, not programming a computer.

4. **Don't overload** - Avoid cramming too many instructions into one prompt. Break complex tasks into simpler parts.

5. **Consider your model** - Different models respond better to different structures (e.g., GPT-4 likes clear formatting, Claude prefers declarative phrasing).

6. **Version control matters** - Track prompt versions so you can compare performance and roll back if needed.

---

## Variables for Dynamic Prompts

For reusable templates, use variables for content that changes:

\`\`\`
User's question: {{user_question}}
User's experience level: {{experience_level}}
Preferred programming language: {{language}}
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Variables make prompts flexible and reusable across different contexts without rewriting the entire prompt.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:** "Help the user with code"
✅ **Specific:** "Help the user debug Python errors by identifying the issue, explaining why it occurred, and suggesting a fix"

❌ **Conflicting instructions:** "Be brief but explain everything in detail"
✅ **Clear priorities:** "Provide concise summaries, with the option to elaborate if the user asks"

❌ **No examples:** Just describing what you want
✅ **With examples:** Showing exactly what good output looks like

---

**Remember:** A good system prompt is clear, dense, and easy to understand, leaving no room for misinterpretation. Start simple, test thoroughly, and refine based on real results.`
